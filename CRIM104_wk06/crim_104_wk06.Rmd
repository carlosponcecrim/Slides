## Challenged previous explanations
- Off-shoot of older theories (particularly *symbolic interactionism*) that challenged previous definitions of deviance, noting that:
    - Earlier theories placed too much emphasis on the individual deviant and neglected to look at reaction to deviance
    - Illegality of some acts is not universal, which questions the notion that people who commit crimes are inexorably bad 

## Focus on social reaction to deviance

- *Also known as the social reaction school:* Argues that what matters is how society reacts to deviant acts
- Developed into 2 perspectives which focus on:
    - The way in which people react to and label others
    - The effect of the label has on the labeled

## Early labeling theory literature

- Frank Tannenbaum’s 1938 book Crime and the Community:
    - Criminal behavior is a product of conflict between a group and the community at large with opposing definitions of appropriate behavior
    - “Tag”  attached to child caught in delinquent activity. 
    - The "tag" may change the child’s self-image and causes people to react to the it, not the child.

## Definition of Crime (Becker)
- Different conceptions of what is right and proper
- Deviant act = criminal act only if law reflects the values of group that considers act deviant


## Labeling as a result of Societal reaction
- Label treated as the dependent variable
- Deviance is a product of others applying rules and laws to a presumed offender
- Types of deviant behaviour:
    - Falsely accused acts
    - Pure deviant acts 
    - Conforming acts
    - Secret deviant acts

## Labeling as a cause of deviance

- Label as an independent variable treated as independent variable
- Two ways in which this may take place: 
    - Labeling audience are more aware of individual and continue labeling him/her
    - Label internalized by the individual which leads to an acceptance of a deviant self-concept

## Lemert’s Secondary deviance
- Individual responses to society's reaction vary
- Individual does not identify the initial act (primary deviance) as an important part of self-image. 
- If original self-image is weak, labeled person may accept imposed label
- Secondary deviance results from process in which labeled person finally accepts the label

## Master Status and Retrospective Interpretation
- Master status: notion that certain traits take-over our perception of the identity of others
- Auxiliary status: notion that certain traits are ignored over an individual's master status
- Once labeled a criminal, this becomes the individual’s master status
- Retrospective interpretation. The identities of individuals that get labelled are reconstructed to fit their "criminal" master status.
