## Crime classifications

- Official typologies
- Scientific or academic typologies

# Official crime typologies

## Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/CRIM100_wk05/ucr_process.JPG)

## UCR History

- Used by the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics (CCJS) to  collect police-reported crime statistic
- Operating in Canada since 1962
- Provides key information for crime analysis, resource planning and program development
- Has 2 data collection instruments:
    - UCR 1: collects aggregate data
    - UCR 2: COllects micrdata on events and participants (referred to as the incident-based survey)

## UCR Crime Typology

- Crimes Against the Person
- Crimes Against Property
- Other criminal Code Violations
- Controlled Drugs And Substances Act
- Other Federal Statute Violations
- Criminal Code Traffic Violations

## Aggregated Data vs Disaggregated Data
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/CRIM100_wk05/agg_crime_data.JPG)

## Question:
What are some of the disavantages and advantages of using aggregated vs disaggregated data?

## UCR Crime Typology
- *Crimes Against the Person:* Unlawful acts perpetrated with the use or threat of use of force and/or result in freedom deprivation
- *Crimes Against Property:* Unlawful acts perpetrated with the intent of gaining property by without the use or threat of violence.
- *Other criminal Code Violations:* Neither violent nor property-related offences.
- *Controlled Drugs And Substances Act:* Unlawful acts related to supply and/or possession of prohibited drugs.

## Violations Causing Death

- Murder 1st Degree
- Murder 2nd Degree
- Manslaughter

## Homicide
- Culpable homicide
- Non-culpable homicide

## Measuring crime
- Crime counts – volume of crime
- Crime rates – risk of crime
- Location quotients of crime – crime specialization


# Limitations of Official Crime statistics

## The Crime Funnel

## Constructionist Perspective
- Focuses on the production of crime statistics
- Notes how police practices affect crime stats (choosing calls, exercising discretion & policing styles)

## Homicide: Best indicator

## Question:

What other crimes do you think have a relatively low dark figure?

## Differences in Canadian Homicides by Sources (Gabor et al, 2002)

## Quantitative Crime Research
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/CRIM100_wk05/quantitative_crime_research.JPG)

## Benefits of victimization surveys (Evans & Leger, 1979)
- Overcome dark figure problem
- Impact of crime
- Victimization risk
- Victims’ perceptions

## Canada’s victimization surveys
- General Social Survey (GSS)
- Violence against women survey (VAWSS)
- International Crime Victims Survey

## Victimology
- Sub-field of criminology
- Focused on victims
    - VOR
    - Victim’s experience
    - CJS

## Evolution of victimology
- Early theoretical focus:
    - How do victims contribute to crime?
- Victim blaming criticisms 
    - Preventive aim cited as a response
    - Ultimately more applied approach was adopted that focused on:
      - Assistance
      - Victims’ rights

## Victim Centered Theories
- Victim Precipitation Theory
- Lifestyle Theory
- Routine Activity Theory

## Victim Precipitation Theory
Focused on explaining how victims’ actions or inactions lead to their victimization
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/CRIM100_wk05/baby_precipitation.jpg)


## Lifestyle Theory
- Its main premise is that differences in risks of victimization are associated with differences in lifestyles. 
    - Equivalent group hypothesis
    - Proximity hypothesis
    - Deviant place hypothesis


## Routine Activity Theory

# Academic Typologies

## Historical Roots

- Lombroso’s (1876) 6 types offenders
    - The born criminal
    - The epileptic criminal
    - The criminal of irresistible passion
    - The insane or feebleminded criminal
    - The occasional criminal
    - The persistent and non-abnormal type of criminal


## The Formulation of Typologies Requires
- Maximization of intra-group homogeneity
- Maximization inter-group heterogeneity
- Using defined attributes as discrimination criteria
- Theoretical basis
- Systematic observation and evaluation
    - Qualitative or quantitative methods
    
## Grouping Criteria
- Victim characteristics 
- Offenders characteristic
- Nature of victim-offender relationship 
- Event circumstances and characteristics 
- Motivation 

## Homicides
- Parricide
- Infanticide
- Feminicide
- Spree homicide
- Serial homicide

## Fesbach’s (1964) typology

## Sexual Murder typologies

## Policy Benefits and Uses
- Risk levels
- Treatment 
- Controls for targeted offender groups
