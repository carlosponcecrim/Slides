## Shaw & McKay's Cultural Transmission Theory
- Juveniles in socially-disorganized areas have greater exposure to & opportunity for delinquency & crime
- Existing delinquent/criminal values in area are transmitted to the youth


## Symbolic Interactionism

- Our behaviour is shaped by the meaning we assign to things
- Meanings are derived from our interactions with others
- Our self identity are determined by our interactions with others
- Identities are situation-specific

## Selling's Conflict Theory 

- Behaviours are confined by rules of conduct learned in childhood
- Rules may vary among cultures
- Dominant group in society may turn its rules into laws
- Types of conflict with these rules
    - Primary conflict: two different cultures govern behaviour (immigrants)
    - Secondary conflict: subcultures with different values that develop in certain areas

# Differential Association Theory
