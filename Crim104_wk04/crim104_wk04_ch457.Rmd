## Today's theories
- Social disorganization theory
- Cultural transmission theory
- Differential association theory
- Subculture of delinquency theory
- Differential opportunity theory

# The Chicago School

## The Chicago School's context
- Various social changes led to:
    - Rapid urbanization 
    - Increased visibility of poverty
- Intellectual interests:
    - Scrutiny of urban poor’s condition
    - Emphasis on social “science” and scientific studies
    - Sociological interpretation/application of biological concepts
        - Often referred to as the Ecological School

## Shaw & McKay's Cultural Transmission Theory
- Juveniles in socially-disorganized areas have greater exposure to & opportunity for delinquency & crime
- Existing delinquent/criminal values in area are transmitted to the youth


## Symbolic Interactionism

- Our behaviour is shaped by the meaning we assign to things
- Meanings are derived from our interactions with others
- Our self identity are determined by our interactions with others
- Identities are situation-specific

## Selling's Conflict Theory 

- Behaviours are confined by rules of conduct learned in childhood
- Rules may vary among cultures
- Dominant group in society may turn its rules into laws
- Types of conflict with these rules
    - Primary conflict: two different cultures govern behaviour (immigrants)
    - Secondary conflict: subcultures with different values that develop in certain areas

# Differential Association Theory

## Your friend is bad influence!

## Sutherland's Differential Association

## Differential Association Theory: Nine Propostions
- Criminal behaviour is learned (just as any other behavior)
- Learning takes places in social settings 
- The largest part of learning takes place with those who are most important to us
- The intimate social environment provides setting for learning two things: 
    - How to accomplish behaviour 
    - How view that behaviour


## Differential Association Theory: Main Points
- Values about certain behaviour may conflict with laws
- As we receive many statements about values, the weight of those statements (importance and closeness of those who convey them) is more important than actual number of statements
- Criminal behaviour takes place when weight of the values concerning a particular behaviour is in opposition to the legal codes

# Subculture Theories

## How does this set of rules and views develop?
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/Crim104_wk04/dissecting_DA.JPG)

## Subcultural Theories
- Proposed 1950s-1960s
- These theories focus on: 
    - Gang delinquency theories (except Subculture of violence theory)
    - The lower-class
    - Urban areas
    - Minorities
    
## Today's theories
- Cohen's Subculture of Delinquecy
- Cloward & Ohlin's Differential Opportunity Theory
- Wolfgang & Ferracuti's Subculture of Violence

## Cohen's Subculture of Delinquency
- Society members share a common value system
- Value system presents cultural goals, most of which build status
- Social institutions (schools) use those values in evaluating students
- Lower-class kids:
    - Have decreased opportunities to reach goals and build status
    - Status deprivation leads to frustration (anomie) 
    - Status frustration creates a reaction formation based on construction of anti-conventional standards and values 
    - Delinquent solution transmitted from kid to kid
