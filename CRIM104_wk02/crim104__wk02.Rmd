# Today's topics
- What is a theory?
- How can to distinguish a GOOD theory?
- Theories as part of a larger context

# What is a theory?

## Back row is always overcrowded

## The essence of theories

## In the context of crime?

## Everyday theories are based on:

- Popular Belief
- Value-driven Explanations
- Speculation
- Opinion

## Scientific theories

## Factual vs proven

# How can to distinguish a GOOD theory?

## The criteria most often used today are:
- Testability
- Best fit to research evidence

##  Other criteria for good theory:
- Logical soundness
- Ability to make sense of conflicting positions
- Sensitizing qualities
- Popularity 

# Theories as part of a larger context

## Theories differ in terms of:
- What they try to explain
- The type of approach they take
- What they focus on
- What they cover

## Two General Types of Criminological Theories
- Unit Theory
    - Focus on one phenomenon
    - Testable
- Metatheory
    - Focus on perception of reality
    - Rarely testable

## Levels of Abstraction in Theory

- A macrotheory is the most abstract
    - Social structure
    - Crime rates
    - Epidemiological
- A bridging theory is somewhat abstract, less than a macrotheory, more than a microtheory
- A microtheory is the least abstract
    - Etiological
    - Based on views of society to explain criminal behaviour

## Other Ways to Classify Theories

- Classical vs. Positivist
- Structural vs. Processual
- Consensus vs. Conflict

## Social & Intellectual Context Shape Theories

- Social Context: Events and beliefs of the times
- Intellectual Context: Books, mentors, and influences important to the theorist

## Theory and policy
