## Abadinsky's (2010) Definition
- Organized crime:
    - Has no political goals
    - Is hierarchical
    - Has a limited or exclusive membership
    - Constitutes a unique subculture
    - Perpetuates itself
    - Exhibits a willingness to use illegal violence
    - Is monopolistic
    - Is governed by explicit rules and regulations

## Lupsha's (1996) Stages  of OC 

- Predatory
- Parasitic
- Symbiotic

## Lupsha's Predatory Stage
- Spatially constrained
- Defensive crimes
- Violence: territory, rivals & local monopoly of illicit  use of force
- Offences seek immediate rewards
- Once dominance over territory is established:
    -Extortion of local businesses
    - More sophisticated criminals and politicians start to use them
- Most manageable phase


## Lupsha's Parasitic Stage

- Maturation: age, criminal skills, leadership & role specialization
- Corrupt interaction with politicians
- Window of opportunity for legitimization (full parasitic interaction)
- Supply of illegal goods & services keeps things running smoothly
- The police designate group as organized crime
- Group is featured in TV & movies
- Group accumulates enough money to:
    - Finance and support political campaigns
    - Secure protection from corrupt politicians
    - Penetrate the legitimate business world

## Lupsha's Symbiotic Stage

- Parasitic relationship becomes mutual
- Group holds monopoly over certain legal and illegal businesses
- Group becomes a key player in political dynamic
