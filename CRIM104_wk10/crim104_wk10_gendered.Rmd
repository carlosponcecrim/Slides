## Overview

- Background
- Social traits in feminist theories
- Gender gap
- The concept of economic marginalization
- Gender-based theories of criminality

# Background

## Basic directions of gender theory

- Traditional theory is androcentric (male-centered)
- Theory needs greater gender sensitivity & explanations of female criminality

## Social and intellectual context
- Social context
    - Emerged during the 1970s
    - Civil-equality movement spread to women
    - Awareness of power and who was dominated

- Intellectual context
- Popularity of conflict theories
- Feminist issues spread to criminology


## Freda Adler's groundbreaking work

- Masculinity Thesis (or liberation hypothesis)
- Women’s Movement -> changed women's roles
- Masculinizing of women's behaviours
- Predicts women will commit more traditional male crimes

## Rita J. Simon – Opportunity Thesis (1975)

- Historically, women had limited access to crime opportunities
- Social structure + private family = limited access
- Access to crime opportunities increased through:
    - Equality in workplace 
    - Being outside home 

# Social traits in feminist theories

## Social traits in feminist theories

- Paternalism
- Chilvary
- Sexism

## Paternalism

- Males need to “protect” females
    - Females in subservient roles
    - Men are “just being protectors”
    - Social organization around independence of males and dependence of females
    - Female behavior more scrutinized & controlled
- Results
    - Female juveniles detained more often
    - Home victimization (under guise of “protecting”)
    - Keeps males in power position (facilitates certain offences)

## Chilvary

- Chivalry Hypothesis: Males need to “protect” females (offshoot of paternalism)
- Women are seen as in greater need of protection and being “taken care of” by men
- Women Treated more leniently in CJS 
- Chivalry appears to be complex: It involves stereotypical expectations

## Sexism

- Attitudes & practices creating inequality between the sexes
    - Sometimes known as “double-standard”
    - Females overdetained for “sex-related” offenses 
    - Mothers held responsible by social service agencies
- Explains differences in types of crimes between males & females


# Gender gap

## Gender gap

- Gender Gap:  Difference between crimes committed by women and crimes than men
- Typically women commit fewer and less serious crimes

## Why is the gender gap narrowing?

- Women are changing behavior and committing more crimes
    - exposure to poverty, violence and limited opportunities
    - new masculinized roles -> crime is an option
- Outside forces are changing (e.g., harsher judges and police officer) 
- Female offending unchanged, male offending decreasing

# The concept of economic marginalization

## The concept of economic marginalization

- Clarice Feinman/Ngaire Naffine –(1986/1987)
- No opportunities + pressure to compete equally -> increased crime by women
- Bulk of female offenders are unemployed or concentrated in a “pink-collar ghetto”


# Gender-based theories of criminality

## Parental influence

## John Hagan's Power-Control Theory

- Conflict + social control
- Work experience shapes relations in households
    - Differential experencies (social classes and genders)
- Control exercised over kids determines their behavioural preferences
- Parents as power brokers in defining kids’ gender roles 
- Patriarchal family: greater gender gap between sons & daughters (sons more delinquent)
