## Statute laws

- Written laws that prohibit or mandate certain acts
- Enacted by a legislative body, such as the Parliament of Canada
    - Debates
    - Public hearings
    - Analysis
    
## Case Law

- Established by previous court decisions and based on the rule of precedent
- Precedent: A judicial decision that may be used as a standard in subsequent similar cases
- Stare decisis: The principle by which higher courts set precedents that lower courts must follow


## Court hierarchy

## Example: Disclosing HIV Status

- R. v. Cuerrier, [1998] 2 SCR 37 
    - Non-disclosure of HIV status vitiates the consent of uninformed participants
    - Turned otherwise "consensual" sex into aggravated sexual assault
    - Ununiformed participants put at "significant risk of bodily harm“
- R. v. Mabior, [2012] 2 SCR 584
    - Consent not vitiated if risk is mitigated (condom + treatment)
