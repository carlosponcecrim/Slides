- Gangs in Canada

# Defining gangs

## Gang homicide? <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/homicide_scene.jpg">

## What is a gang?

- Lack of universally accepted definition
- Definitions vary cultural and geographic context
- There are a few that are widely used (e.g., the Eurogang gang definition)

## Some examples

- Thrasher (1927)
- Klein (1971)
- Klein, Weerman and Thornberry (2006)
- Howell (2012) 
- FBI (2014)

## Eurogang definition (Klein & Maxson, 2006)

"A street gang (or a troublesome youth group corresponding to a street gang elsewhere) is any durable, street-oriented youth group whose own identity includes involvement in illegal activity."

## Static vs dynamic definitions

- Difficult to capture complexity of problem with static definitions
- Dynamic definitions overcome this limitation

## Gangs as a continuum <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/gang_continuum.JPG">

## Elements linked to gang evolution

- Response to external stimuli
- Changes in offending, organization and focus
- Know-how
- Maturity
- Leadership

## Taylor (1990) - Scavenger gangs
- Nexus based on impulsive behaviour and need to belong
- Volatile leadership
- Target the weakest actors in their neighbourhoods
- Spontaneous and unpurposive offences
- Violence perpetrated for fun
- Lack of objectives and common purpose

## Taylor (1990) - Territorial gangs
- Group identity is created
- Somebody assumes leadership position
- Territory is proclaimed, guarded and defended
- Strangers are considered invaders/enemies
- Start to organize around objectives and specific purposes
- Involvement in drugs
- Group takes advantage of authority vacuum
- Extra-legal rules set by group
- Violence is used to eliminate rivals and deal with noncompliance
- Increased mobility and expansion of territorial coverage 

## Taylor (1990) - Corporate gangs
- Well defined, solid command structure
- Main purpose: illicit activities that generate monetary returns
- Memebership based what individual brings to the grpup
- Merits and not personality allows individuals to escalate hierarchy
- Task designation and specialization

## Gang membership

- Self identification
- Criteria checklist:
    - Gang peer associations
    - Criminal activity with gang members
    - Parent/guardian admission of youth's gang involvement
    - Tattoos and/or use of gang insignia
    - Credible informant identification of a youth as a gang member 

## Gang-motivated vs gang-related offences
- Chicago Police Deparment: motivation-based criteria
- Los Angeles Police Department: participant-based criteria
- Maxson & Klein (1990) found that using Chicago criteria reduced # of gang homicides in LA by aprox 50%



# Gang correlates and theories

## Historical development of gangs
- Immigration waves and inadequate conditions
- European immigrant waves in the US
- Migration of black population from rural to urban areas
- Latin american immigration wave

## Gangs in the US today
- Second generation immigrants more likely to be gang members
- Most older than 18
- 1/3 female
- Hispanics largest ethnic category in gangs
- Hybrid gangs - shift in gang membership and allegiances

## Gang evolution and correlates
- Expressive vs instrumental violence
- Planning or discussing future crimes
- Interaction with formal social control agents
- Organization and structure
- Gangs and drugs
- Gang membership 
- Gang symbols and colors
- Role of prison gangs

## Main theoretical explanations
- Concentrated disadvantage
- Subcultural 
- Lifecourse

## Concentrated disadvantage - Social disorganization theory <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/concentric_circles.png">

## Concentrated disadvantage - Social disorganization theory
- Shaw and McKay 
- Zone II: Highest concentration offences, regardless of the ethnic group
- High crime rates did not follow ethnic groups 
- Nature of neighbourhood not individuals influenced crime rates
- Breakdown in informal social control mechanisms


## Concentrated disadvantage - Social disorganization theory <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/community%20structure%20and%20crime.png">

## Subcultural - Culture of The Gang (Albert Cohen)
- Cultural transmission + structurally induced strain
- Lower-class youth are disadvantaged to achieve middle-class standards of success and status
- Delinquent subculture develops when middle-class goals and norms are substituted
- Once it emerges, delinquent subculture can be transmitted
- The code of the streets (Anderson, 1999)



## Subcultural - Illegitimate opportunity theory
- Cloward & Ohlin
- Adaptation is conditioned by availability of illegitimate means
- Three types of subcultures:
- Criminal subculture in organized neighborhoods
- Conflict or fighting-oriented subculture in disorganized neighborhoods
- The retreatist or drug using subculture when double failures (unable to achieve status legitimately or illegitimately)

## Life-course - Risk and Protective factors
- Focuses on child and adolescent development
- Risk and protective factors change throughout the life course
- Serious delinquency mediates effect of risk factors
- Multiple risk factors increase likelihood of gang membership
- Accumulation of risk factors predicts gang membership


## Life-course - Multiple marginality
- Combination of macro and individual perspectives
- Discrimination and ostracism at the structural level lead to lack of economic and social opportunities, as well as to weakened social institutions(i.e., schools and families) 

# Gangs in Canada
## What do we know about gangs in Canada?
- No precise measure of youth gang involvement
- Results of the 2002 Police Survey of Youth Gangs
- Provincial/local research suggests: Problem across many ethnic, geographic, demographic and socioeconomic contexts

## Populations of interest to Canadian gang scholars
- Aboriginal youth
- Immigrant youth
- Young women

## Aboriginal gangs - Hot spots
- Presence in urban, rural and correctional contexts
- Growing in prairie provinces (Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon and Edmonton) and northern Canada (Iqaluit and Yellowknife)

## Aboriginal gangs - Their relevance
- Concerning because aboriginal population:
    - <i>Growing at a relatively higher rate</i>
    - <i>Currently overrepresented in CJS</i>
    - <i>Has high victimization rate</i>
    - <i>Has high violent offending rate</i>

## Aboriginal gangs - Organization
- Relatively unorganized and unsophisticated
- Volatile membership
- Intergenerational 

## Aboriginal gangs - Gang members
- In fringes of legitimate and illegitimate opportunity structures
- Less educated 
- More economically disadvantaged
- Get involved as early as 8 years old

## Aboriginal gangs - Criminal activity
- Used by more sophisticated criminal organizations for "street work"
- Access to less profitable criminal opportunities 
- Higher rates of internalized violence (compared to externalized)
- Main motivations behind gang violence: revenge, retaliation and reputation

## Aboriginal gangs - Risk factors
- Multiple marginality
    - Racism
    - Marginalization 
    - Colonialization 
    - loss of culture
    - loss of land
    - poverty
    - Intergenerational violence
    - Unemployment
    - Issues of poor health

## Aboriginal gangs - Risk factors
- Individual factors
    - Stressful experiences, early life hardships and negative emotions coming from marginality in other life domains
    - Involvement in delinquency
    - Early substance abuse
    - Associating with gang members
    - Weak school attachment
    - Family gang involvement
    - Poor parental monitoring 
    - Parental neglect/abuse
    - Involvement in the Aboriginal child welfare system
