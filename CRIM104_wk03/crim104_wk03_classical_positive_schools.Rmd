- Exploration of humanity
- Capricious and cruel criminal justice system

- Critique of harsh & barbaric government
- Reforms encouraged
- Education & enlightenment (belief in power of human reason – logic )

## Important features
- Not really a theory of crime causation
- Focused on how to address crime 
    - Punishment should be just, fair, proportionate & less cruel
    - Laws should be clear and impartial, equitable with less discretion

# Guiding premises of the Classical School    

## Free will

## Hedonism
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/CRIM104_wk03/hedonism.jpg)

## Rational punishment rather than revenge

## Utilitarianism
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/CRIM104_wk03/utilitarianism.jpg)

## Due process
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/CRIM104_wk03/due_process.jpg)

## Social contract
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/CRIM104_wk03/social_contract.jpg)

## Social contract
- A political philosophy to justify government
- A contract that exists between the state & its citizens
- State exists to serve the citizens
- State can only exercise authority granted by citizens
- Individuals surrender to the state only the limited rights necessary to ensure protection of all citizens
- Life cannot be surrendered

## Deterrence
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/CRIM104_wk03/deterrence.png)

## Forms of deterrence

- Specific deterrence
    - Legal punishment given directly to offender
    - Designed to remove gains 
    - Individual assesses lack of gain & decides not to repeat similar acts

- General deterrence
    - Others aware of an individual being punished
    - Realize no gains from violation of law
    - Assumes public nature of punishment

## Elements of deterrence

- Celerity: Speed with which punishment is applied after act occurs

- Certainty: Likelihood of being caught and punishment being applied

- Severity: Amount or degree of punishment, relative to the act


# Positivist School of Criminology

## Positivism
- Not a theory but a philosophy 
    - Use of science in regulating the world
- Basic features
    - Systematic observation
    - Accumulation of evidence
    - Objective fact
    - Deductive framework

## The Positivist School in brief
- First scientific perspective on crime & criminals
- Emphasis on empiricism and valued scientific expertise
- Determinism

## Positive School Influences
- Rise of science as influential form of knowledge
- The work of Darwin in evolution & social Darwinism
- Cartographics and “social statistics”
- Anthropological evidence from “primitive” peoples
- Idea of perfecting humankind through science


## Early Biological Positivism
- Physiognomy 
    - Body characteristics assumed related to behavior
- Phrenology
    - Head structure (“bumps on the head”) 
    - Assumed related to behavior

## Psychogenic Causes of Crime
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/CRIM104_wk03/psychogenic_causes.JPG)

## Eugenics and Psychological Movements

- Popular ideas spread from biological work:
    - Dangerous classes
    - Criminals are degenerates
- Eugenics movement spread from atavist concept
- Studies used cases where criminal lineage was traced
    - Dugdale:  The Jukes, 1877
    - Goddard:  The Kallikaks, 1912

# Anomie Theory

## Emile Durkheim (1857-1917)
- French philosopher
- Sociology was new, positivist field
- Social structure and social determinism
- Individual as product of the society
- Saw society as evolving
    - After French revolution–rapid industrialization

## Agrarian society
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/CRIM104_wk03/agrarian.jpg)

## Industrialized society
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/CRIM104_wk03/industrial.jpg)

## Durkheim’s Perspective

- Society’s evolution: from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity
- Evolution destabilizes equilibrium
- Organic societies have continual state of anomie (lawlessness)
- Balance forces integration and forces of regulation = balance

## Durkheim's view on crime

- Crime is normal, serves function of helping society develop order
- Punishment necessary to ensure protection of norms, maintains social solidarity
- Focus on social conditions where rules lose value
- Without a regulated society as a guide, individuals are confused & can’t adjust; this is anomie

# Anomie-strain theory 

## Anomie-strain theory in brief
- Robert Merton (1938)
- Focused on social structure & cultural disparities in American society
- Studied relationship between social structure and opportunity, particularly for African Americans
- Saw strain from social disjunction between goals and means of society
    - Goals: what one should strive for (money, success, status)
    - Means: ways of attaining goals (approved and not)

## Anomie-strain theory - Main premises
- American Dream
    - Over emphasis on the accumulation of wealth as a measure of success
- Access to legitimate means is unequally distributed
- Problems matching goals/means 
- Social class pyramid keeps poor on bottom
- Society is contract-based
- Crime and deviance result as people adapt to unequal access to means to reach success  

## Modes of adaptation to strain
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosponcecrim/Slides/master/CRIM104_wk03/adaptation.JPG)


## Main influences

- Conditions produced by Great Depression
- Govt. response: change social structure, create work programs, create and collect social data
- Durkheim and social-structure ideas
- Competition between Chicago School and “East Coast” sociology
- Parson’s grand theory 
    - Fit with Durkheim’s structural-functionalist ideas, suggested rates of crime in society need to be explained, not individual crime

# Strain based theories

## General Strain Theory 
- Agnew (1985)
- Basic premise:
    - Teens experience other, more immediate sources of strain (appearance, popularity, school, etc)
- Strain experienced by teens 
    - Introduction of negative stimuli
    - Removal of positive stimuli
- Strains may lead to frustration, anger, and delinquency 


## Institutional Anomie Theory
- Steven Messner and Richard Rosenfeld (1994)
- Main premise:
    - Failure of social institutions (political system, education, family, and the economy) to integrate and regulate the pursuit of goals in a capitalist society
- Institutional imbalance (institutional-anomie), in which the economy dominates political system, education, and the family
    - This leads to an amoral “ends justifies the means” attitude in society
