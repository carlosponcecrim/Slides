## Forms of deterrence

- Specific deterrence

    - Designed to remove gains 
    - Individual assesses lack of gain & decides not to repeat similar acts

    - Realize no gains from violation of law
    - Assumes public nature of punishment

## Elements of deterrence

- Celerity: Speed with which punishment is applied after act occurs

- Certainty: Likelihood of being caught and punishment being applied

- Severity: Amount or degree of punishment, relative to the act
